Fail to load tokenizer config with error=stat: path should be string, bytes, os.PathLike or integer, not NoneType

WARNING It is recommended to use the `Chat` or `Instruct` model for benchmarking.
Because when the tokenizer counts the output tokens, if there is gibberish, it might count incorrectly.

Fail to load tokenizer config with error=stat: path should be string, bytes, os.PathLike or integer, not NoneType

WARNING It is recommended to use the `Chat` or `Instruct` model for benchmarking.
Because when the tokenizer counts the output tokens, if there is gibberish, it might count incorrectly.

Fail to load tokenizer config with error=stat: path should be string, bytes, os.PathLike or integer, not NoneType

WARNING It is recommended to use the `Chat` or `Instruct` model for benchmarking.
Because when the tokenizer counts the output tokens, if there is gibberish, it might count incorrectly.
